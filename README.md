# Covid-19-Predictions

About the Model:-

This is a model which uses a Neural network to predict the effects of corona virus in different countries of the world. It is based on the dataset available at global challenge week 1 for Covid 19 at Kaggle.

Structure of the Network

This is a shallow neural network containing only an input layer and an output layer, consisting of 4 and 2 neurons respectively. There are no hidden layers as they would overfit this small amounts of data.

I/O details

The model uses the latitude and longitude of a country as well as date as the major input features to perform predictions, and outputs predicted confirmed number of cases and fatalities.
